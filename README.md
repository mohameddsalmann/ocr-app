## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Performance Settings
The application includes several optimization settings that can be modified in the code:

```python
# In main.py - OptimizedArabicOCRApp.__init__()
self.max_workers = min(4, multiprocessing.cpu_count())  # Thread count
self.batch_size = 5                                     # PDF pages per batch
self.max_dimension = 1800                               # Max image dimension
```

### OCR Settings
```python
# Confidence threshold for text detection (line 280)
if res[2] > 0.3:  # Adjust this value (0.0 to 1.0)
```

### Image Processing Settings
```python
# PDF rendering DPI (line 250)
mat = fitz.Matrix(1.5, 1.5)  # Lower DPI for speed

# Image preprocessing (lines 200-210)
denoised = cv2.bilateralFilter(gray, 9, 75, 75)
_, thresh = cv2.threshold(denoised, 0, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY + cv2.THRESH_OTSU)
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Installation Problems
- **Import Errors**: Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly
- **Version Conflicts**: Use a virtual environment
- **Missing Libraries**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

#### Performance Issues
- **Slow Processing**: Reduce `max_workers` or `batch_size`
- **Memory Errors**: Close other applications or reduce `max_dimension`
- **Large Files**: Process in smaller batches

#### OCR Accuracy
- **Poor Results**: Ensure good image quality
- **Missing Text**: Lower confidence threshold (currently 0.3)
- **Wrong Language**: Check if text is clearly visible

### Error Messages

| Error | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "OCR initialization failed" | Check internet connection for model download |
| "Failed to load image" | Verify file format and corruption |
| "Memory error" | Reduce batch size or image dimensions |

## üìä Performance Tips

### For Best Results
1. **Image Quality**: Use high-resolution, clear images
2. **File Size**: Optimize images before processing
3. **Text Clarity**: Ensure text is clearly visible and not blurred
4. **Background**: Use documents with good contrast

### Optimization Settings
- **Small Documents**: Increase `batch_size` for faster processing
- **Large Documents**: Decrease `batch_size` to reduce memory usage
- **Low-end Systems**: Reduce `max_workers` to 2 or 1
